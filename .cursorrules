1. You have tools available to you, use them!
2. Always search through the codebase before attempting to implement something.
3. If you are unsure about something, ask!
4. Only make small, targeted changes each time, rather than sweeping changes.
5. NEVER remove or touch code that isn't relevant to the feature you are working on.
6. Functional components only, no classes.

This project uses a custom JSX framework, with a state manager and event manager.

DATA ATTRIBUTES FOR EVENTS ARE NO LONGER USED!
